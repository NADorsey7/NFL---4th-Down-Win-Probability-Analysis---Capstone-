# 4th Down Decisions: NFL Analytics Capstone

This project analyzes 4th down decision-making in the NFL from 2018 to 2023, comparing actual coaching decisions to win probability models.

## Overview
Using real NFL play-by-play data and tools like SQL, R, and Tableau, I identified trends, coaching patterns, and potential inefficiencies in 4th down strategies.

### Key Objectives
- Determine aggressiveness of NFL teams on 4th down from 2018 to 2023
- Measure alignment with analytics-based win probability models
- Visualize tendencies by coach, distance, and field position

## Tools Used
- **SQL** – Data wrangling
- **R** – Statistical modeling
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboards
- **GitHub** – Version control
- **NFLfastR** – Data source

## Key Files
- `nfl_4th Down Dataset.csv`: Cleaned dataset
- `Tableau_Dashboard.png`: Interactive Visual
- `4th Down WP.Rmd`: Predictive modeling notebook in R
- '4th Down WP.ipynd': Predictive Modeling Notebook in Python
- `Capstone Summary Slide Deck.pdf`: Slide summary

## Highlights
- Identified a +2.8% average WP swing for aggressive teams like the Ravens
- Found that 37% of punts between the opponent’s 40–50 were suboptimal
- Built dashboards for quick comparison of coach tendencies

## Next Steps
- Expand to include overtime and playoff scenarios
- Incorporate defensive strength into decision-making models
- Automate data refresh using scheduled R scripts or Python pipelines
